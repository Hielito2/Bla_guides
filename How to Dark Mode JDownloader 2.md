How to Dark Mode JDownloader 2 

 I figured an easy way to set JDownloader 2 to dark mode without modifying system files or downloading external files from the internet.

1. First we go to the Settings tab, scroll down on the left side-bar and click on Advanced Settings, this is where we'll be working.

2. On the search bar type "theme" (without the " "s), and change the value to BLACK_EYE.

    JD will prompt you to download and install the theme package, click Ok, and install.
    If it's doesn't automatically, close and reopen JDownloader.

    When you open it again, JD will look all messed up, this is normal and we will fix it in the following steps.

 3. In the Advanced Settings search bar, type "color back".

    Change all the whites and light blues to dark grey or black.

    Do not change the red and yellow, only change the whites and light blues.

    You might want to make the first 3 values a bit lighter shade of dark grey for functionality.

    Go to the RGB tab and copy-paste the "222222" color code.

    Alternatively, you can change the "Value", "Darkness" or "Black" values in the HSV, HSL or CMYK tabs respectively to adjust how dark you want your dark mode.

     The "Color For Table Alternate Row Background" seems to bug out for some reason and not take the "222222" color code, to fix this, set it to some other color first, and then change it to dark grey or black.

    4. Back on Advanced Settings, search "color fore", and change all the blacks and whites to white.

    Again, do not change the red, and blues, only the whites and blacks.

    Some values are set to white by default, but I like to set them manually anyway to make sure they will display properly.

    5. Finally search "color text", and change all the colors to white.

    Only the "Config Label Disabled Text Color" goes grey.

     6. Restart JDownloader and your dark theme should be all set up.

     Every time JD updates, the color settings will be back to default, and it will look messed up, simply close and reopen JD again, and the colors should be back to normal.

    You don't need to set it all up again.
