GUIDE: How to install and debloat Jdownloader
Guide

JDownloader can speed up your downloads by splitting them into multiple parts, but it also comes with some annoying ads and features that you may want to get rid of. Here are the steps to do so:

  Go to https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2 and click on the button of your operating system to download the setup file.

  Run the setup file and follow the installation instructions. You can choose the installation directory and language during this process.

  Once JDownloader is installed, open it and go to Settings -> Advanced Settings (the icon with a warning sign).

  In the Filters Settings, search for the following values and disable them by clicking on the check-mark button:

- premium alert

- oboom

- Special Deals

- Donate

- Banner

5. These values are responsible for showing ads and pop-ups for premium accounts and other offers. Disabling them will make JDownloader ad-free and less cluttered.

6. You can also optimize JDownloader by doing the following:

- Disable speed limits by going to Settings -> Speed Limit -> No Limit

- Minimize and resize the window when downloading to save screen space

- Disable window decoration by going to Settings -> User Interface -> Window Decoration -> None

- Disable speed meter graph by right-clicking on it or going to Advanced Settings and unchecking GraphicalUserInterfaceSettings.speedmeterenabled

- Set logging to off by going to Advanced Settings and unchecking Log.Loglevel

- Turn off your VPN if you don't need it, as it can affect your download speed

- Turn off addons that you don't use or need by going to Settings -> Addons and unchecking them

That's it! You now have a fully installed and debloated JDownloader that can download files faster and without interruptions. I hope this guide was helpful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to comment below.
